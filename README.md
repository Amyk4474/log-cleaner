## What problem does it solve?
Log files are full of boring "INFO" lines. This script finds ONLY the important "ERROR" and "WARNING" lines so you can fix problems fast!

## How to use 
1. Clone this repo
2. Run: `./clean-log.sh your-log-file.log`
3. Get a clean file with just errors/warnings + a summary.
